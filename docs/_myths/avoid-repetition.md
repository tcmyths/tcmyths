Using the same word to mean something that's used frequently should be avoided. Use synonyms to mix it up and keep it interesting.

## Background

Furia ([Ten myths about technical writing]({{ site.mybaseurl }}/refs/ten-myths-about-technical-writing)) describes how this is a rule to keep reading interesting and illustrates how application of this rule can become unintentionally comedic. He then cites Strunk and White (1999) to say that a single word should be used to mean a single topic to improve clarity and prevent confusion.

## Survival tips

Follow the style guide. For technical communication be clear and consistent with your terms.

## Commentary

This looks less like a myth and more like a rule for one genre (creative writing) being applied, inappropriately, to another (technical writing).
