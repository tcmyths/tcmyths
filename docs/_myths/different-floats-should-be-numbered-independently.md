Tables and figures should be numbered independently.

## Background

Furia () describes this as "another mainstream practice of typography" and explains how this system does not help the reader find, for example, Figure 1, after they find Table 2. He asserts that adopting a sequential numbering scheme for elements inserted into the text would make it easier for the reader to navigate from one to another.

## Survival tips

Follow the style guide for your publication. 

If you are creating a style guide, do what makes it easiest for the reader.

## Commentary

This is a style matter. While an argument for sequentially numbered inserts seems reasonable to apply in online content, I'm not aware of any research that indicates readers have found the separate numbering scheme to be troublesome. At the same time, not following a convention that is expected by the reader can introduce confusion, albeit temporarily.
