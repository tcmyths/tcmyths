Documentation can be created or added at the end of a product development cycle to fix or accommodate any shortcomings of a product's design or implementation.

## Background

Hart ([Ten Technical Communication Myths]({{ site.mybaseurl }}/refs/ten-technical-communication-myths)) does not cite any research or provide any case studies or other emperical research that supports or refutes this myth. It does, however, seem reasonable to believe that a difficult interface will still be difficult to use with documentation. Somewhat less so with the help of documentation, but difficult nonetheless.

## Survival tips

Hart cites Carliner (1998) who suggests that technical writers insert themselves earlier in the design process, while acknowledging that can go against the corporate culture. 

If you're a writer who ends up in the unenviable position of documenting a product with a less-than-perfect design, start by empathizing with your reader/customer/user and working back to identify the gaps and challenges and provide guidance around and through them. Your reader will appreciate the effort (even if no one else does).

## Commentary

This is to technical writing as _"We'll fix it in post"_ is to filmmaking. In practice, the flaws in a design (script, blueprint, etc.) tend to get worse over time rather than get better.
