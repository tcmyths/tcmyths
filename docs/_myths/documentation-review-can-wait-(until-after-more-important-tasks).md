Documentation is not as important as _real_ work, coding, for example.

## Background

Prakash ([Technical Writing: 10 Myths and Facts (Part 2)]({{ site.mybaseurl }}/refs/technical-writing-10-myths-and-facts-part-2)) asserts this without evidence and continues, noting, "that there is a lot of work in documentation, too." 

## Survival tips

As Prakash describes, late or incomplete documentation can delay a product as effectively as late or incomplete code. Therefore, documentation should be considered as much of a feature of the finished product as any other feature.

## Commentary

While I've heard this idea raised, it's important to consider the context. Sometimes, the documentation can wait, while other times, it can't. It really depends on the individual circumstance. Like so many other myths, one size (application) does not fit all.
